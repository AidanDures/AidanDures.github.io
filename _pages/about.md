I am a first year PhD student on the Digital Twins for Healthcare CDT at King's College London. My project involves researching how Process Mining can be applied to a UK Healthcare Department to help understand discrepancies between models of the department and the real process. My first supervisor is Dr Steffen Zschaler, and this project is funded by and in collaboration with Synoptix Ltd. 

Before I came to King's, I worked for a year in the Environmental Compliance sector, and before that completed my integrated master's degree in maths from Oxford. 


# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
